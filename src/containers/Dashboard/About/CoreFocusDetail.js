				<h3>My Core Focus</h3>
				<p>I was born a maker. As a kid, I loved Barbie dolls, but the thing I liked best about playing with them was making little houses out of cardboard and paper. This was partly a product of a big family and no money to buy a Barbie Dreamhouse and partly because I would have likely cut up the dreamhouse anyway to “customize” it (good call mom).  As a grown-up I am an unabashed DIYer making all kinds of things (furniture, candles/soap, jewelry, any manner of food or bakery, clothes, etc). Currently, I’m spending time learning a new medium, code, so I can create things digitally. And I’m really motivated to make things that are beautiful and serve a useful purpose.
